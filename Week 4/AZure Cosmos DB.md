Azure Cosmos DB is a fast NoSQL database service for modern app development at any scale.

## Retail/marketing

In this example, a JavaScript web application, built on content stored in Azure Blob Storage, uses Azure Cosmos DB SQL API as it's backing database. 
Multiple accounts are used to manage different facets of the solution such as the shopping cart, inventory, or catalog. Azure Cosmos DB SQL API data is then indexed by Azure Search to provide a rich search experience to end users.

## Web/mobile

In this example, a user is using a URL to access a web site in their browser. The URL points to Azure Traffic Manager, which then uses a built-in algorithm to determine which Azure App Service endpoint to redirect the user to. Since Azure Cosmos DB SQL API is capable of global distribution, you only need one account that is replicated across multiple regions.
