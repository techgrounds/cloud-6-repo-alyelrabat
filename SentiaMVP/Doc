# Project Version 1.0

## Working with IaC

This project has been one of the best experiences in my current path to becomming an IT proffesional.
Bicep is a relatively new concept and very smart when it comes to deploying resources into Azure.
I havent had any experience with such a industrial level of coding so i am very grateful for the experience.

Deploying with VS Code has been a great asset to my education on becoming a Cloud Consultant for Microsoft Azure due learning
about the many functions and requirments to have a working Azure infrastructure.
This part of the curricullum has been very challenging and has givin me insight to how much value coding is to understanding
the engineering aspect of cloud infrastructure
